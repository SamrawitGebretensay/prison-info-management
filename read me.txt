
Prison management refers to the system and processes used to oversee the operation, security, and rehabilitation functions within correctional facilities. Effective prison management ensures that inmates are securely housed, their rights are respected, and rehabilitation programs are provided to prepare them for reintegration into society. This includes managing prisoner data, controlling movements, monitoring behavior, and organizing resources like food, healthcare, and legal support. Authorities also focus on maintaining order within the prison through trained personnel, surveillance systems, and structured routines.

Modern prison management systems often utilize technology to streamline operations. Digital solutions such as Prisoner Information Management Systems (PIMS) are implemented to store and manage prisoner records, track transfers, categorize crimes, schedule visits, and monitor sentence durations. These systems improve transparency, reduce manual errors, and help in decision-making by providing quick access to prisoner histories and facility metrics. In a broader sense, prison management also involves policy development, adherence to human rights standards, and partnerships with judicial and rehabilitation services to create a fair and secure correctional environment
